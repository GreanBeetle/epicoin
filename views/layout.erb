          <h4>What is a blockchain?</h4>
          <p>
          Simply put, a blockchain is a chain of digital records. Each record is called a block. Each block is chained to both the previous and following block by a unique identifier known as a hash. A hash is a sequence of letters and numbers generated by solving a cryptographic puzzle. The process of solving these cryptographic puzzles is known as mining. Every time a puzzle is solved, a new hash and thereby new block is created.
          </p>
          <h4>History of Blockchains</h4>
          <strong>Cypherpunks from the 80s and 90s</strong>
          <p>
          Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology began in the 80s and 90s with a group called the Cypherpunks, who were a loose-knit, international collection of activists. They believed in cryptography and protective, privacy-enhancing technology as a means to political and social change. Deeply mistrustung centralized authority of any sort, they thought that privacy was absolutely essential for a free and open society in the digital age. Governments, corporations, and other large entities, they said, could not be trusted to grant us this privacy.
          <br>
          With respect to code, the Cypherpunks believed someone had to write the software to defend this privacy, and said they were the folks to do that. Their goal? To build a community free from the state and centralized authority. And to do that, they needed digital money.
          </p>
          <h4>The Woes of Digital Money</h4>
          <p>
          There are any number of problems with crafting digital currency and we won't dwell too long on them here. Briefly, though, if you're going to make a cryptocurrency, you need to ensure a few things. First, proper authentication needs to be in place. No one person should be able to access any other person’s account. (That seems obvious these days, but user handles and passwords were not always 'a thing'.) Second, the currency needs to be reliable and available. And that brings into question the usefulness of storing currencies on a central server. If the server goes down? The money is lost. If a government shuts down the server? The currency dies. Finally, central servers aren't (weren't) all that secure. They're vulnerable to hacking. Bad actors and malicious parties can steal the cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <h4>So?</h4>
          <p>
          Decentralize, said the cypherpunks. Kill the server.
          <br>
          <br>
          And they did. It led to the formation of peer-to-peer networks, wherein information and data are distributed among a network of people and their computers. This act of sharing, distributing and storing data on a peer-to-peer network came to be known as gossip.
          </p>
          <h4>About Gossip</h4>
          <p>
          These gossip protocols have certain attractive features. (A gossip protocol being the processes and procedures used to share information on a peer-to-peer network.) Sharing is leaderless. Every one in the gossip chain is equal and replaceable. Also, everyone in the network must connect to every other person to learn about the state of the network.
          <br>
          <br>
          What that meant in the context of cryptocurrency is, if you conducted a transaction with a peer, it took time to propagate through the network, for everyone to learn, say, that Michael had sent 10 cybercoin to Julie.
          <br>
          <br>
          There were problems with this.
          <br>
          <br>
          Bad actors could do something random and screw up the information being shared. Or do something intentionally malicious. Like lie. Henry could have claimed that Michael's cybercoin was in fact meant for him, not Julie. With only gossip channels to confirm or deny Henry's claim, who could say he was wrong? Michael, yes. But if Henry colluded with several other bad actors who supported his claim? It got messy.
          </p>
          <h4>The Cypherpunk Answer to These Problems ...</h4>
          <p>
          ... was cryptography.
          <br>
          <br>
          More specifically, public-key cryptography. 'Public-key' is basically a username and password. It generates two keys for each person, one public, one private. Together, these became your identity on the peer-to-peer network. That meant you could encrypt your transactions and verify both the sender and intented recipient, but it still left a big problem called the double spend.
          <br>
          <br>
          A double spend is when someone simultaneously sends the same information to different people. For example, Michael could have sent his 10 cybercoin to both Julie and Henry, granting two (or more) different people ownership of his cybercoin. In a gossip protocol, where information is slowly shared over a network, how would the network have known which transaction was true?
          </p>
          <h4>Enter the Blockchain</h4>
          <p>
          And finally we arrive at Blockchains. (To recap, blockchains are a chain of digital records wherein each record is linked to both the previous and following records by something called a hash.)
          <br>
          <br>
          The progenitor of this idea was a person or group of people who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Way back in 2008, Nakamoto published a white paper (a report, governmental or otherwise authoritative, proposing ideas about an issue) detailing both the philosophy behind and practical implementation of blockchains. Essentially it described protocol for a new, decentralized digital currency.
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>
          As a sidenote, Satoshi Nakamoto went on to found Bitcoin. Depending on your source (e.g. wikipedia, TIME Magazine, etc.), Nakamoto’s true identity may or may not be known. Some sources claim the NSA identified him using stylometry (the study of linguistic style). Others say that his identity remains a mystery. Whoever he is, he is said to be the world’s most reclusive billionaire, currently valued around $7 billion.
          </i>
          <br>
          <br>
          The biggest problem addressed by the white paper was the simultaneous double-spend. What each transaction on a peer-to-peer needed was a way to immutably (unchangeably) timestamp and order each transaction. This needed to happen without a central server. Nakamoto accomplished this using blockchains. And this is where it gets weird. Here, Nakamato proposed, is how one would create a decentralized time-stamping server. Each new transaction would be verified (or backed up) by computational work that solved a puzzle. These puzzles would be hard, so hard that it would be difficult and nearly impossible to fake solutions (known as proof of work) to the puzzles.
          <br>
          <br>
          When all of that was put into action, it meant that each new block in the chain — that is, each new transaction, each new message — would essentially generate another puzzle in need of a solution. The first person to solve it would then be allowed to send their message or transaction, thus forcing a chronological ordering of transactions and disallowing simultaneous double-spends.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>A Note About the Puzzles</h4>
          <p>
          Nakamoto's puzzles were (still are) to find something called a nonce that, when combined with your message, was fed into a hash function, which in turned produced a hash.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hashes look like this. ‘0000e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649’ Note the leading number of 0s.
          <br>
          <br>
          Your message, this. ‘Hello world’
          <br>
          <br>
          And this is the nonce. ‘Jared, John, Misha, Dave and Andrew are fabulous guys’
          <br>
          <br>
          The trick was to transform the nonce (using a hash function, e.g. your comp) so that it outputted a hash with a certain number of 0s. When fed into hash functions, different nonces yield different results.
          <br>
          <br>
          'Hello world' might produce 'e3b0c44298fc'
          <br>
          <br>
          'Hello worBZ' might produce '0000c44298fc'
          <br>
          <br>
          This latter result, '0000c44298fc', is what Nakamoto was looking for. It was the solution to the puzzle. Find a hash that begins with, say, four 0s. And do that by changing the nonce as many times as necessary. What all of this did, basically, was provide a puzzle answer that was close to impossible to reverse enginner. You could create a hash from a nonce. But you could not create a nonce from a hash.
          </p>
          <h4>Mining</h4>
          <p>
          The process of transforming nonces to produce the desired hashes was dubbed 'mining'. These days we know that it takes a lot of computer power and uses a crapload of electricity to 'mine' cryptocurrency. The electricity required to mine a single bitcoin is more than used by 30 Teslas.
          </p>
          <h4>Blockchains</h4>
          <p>
          Anyhow, here's a visualization of a blockchain.
          </p>
          <img src="">
          <p>
          These are distributed among the peer-to-peer network.
          v. In the early years of blockchain technology, each node (e.g. person, device, point of convergence) in the network retained a facsimile of the entire blockchain.
          vi. These days a node need only keep the blockchain long enough to verify its history and the authenticity of each transaction on the chain, after which the node may discard however much of the blockchain it wants.
          </p>
          <h4>Vocabulary</h4>
          <p>
          Basechain: A Base Chain is a pseudo-blockchain which uses a database instead of a true peer-to-peer network.
          Block. A file or record where data pertaining to a particular cryptocurrency is stored permanently.
          Blockchain. A chain of digital records. Each record in the chain is chronologically linked to both the previous and following record. These records are referred to as blocks, ergo, blockchain. by a unique identifier known as a hash.
          Client. A computer (like your laptop) or application (like, your Chrome browser) that accesses a server.
          Cryptocurrency. Encrypted, digital currency.
          Cryptography. The study and practice of techniques granting secure communication between people.
          Fiat. Fiat currency. Coins or paper money with no intrinsic value that are made legal by fiat (order) of the government. E.g. The dollar and the euro are fiat currencies.
          Genesis block. The first block in a blockchain. It does not have a previous hash.
          Gossip. Gossip protocol. The process of computer to computer communication among peer-to-peer networks.
          Hash. In cryptocurrency, a hash is a long sequence of letters and numbers. Here is an example. ‘e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855’. In blockchains, hashes must be preceded by a number of zeros, like so: ‘0000e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.’ The person who first builds the blockchain decides how many zeros need to precede the hash.
          Mining. Recently, mining has come to mean the process by which transactions are verified, new nonces are discovered and, finally, new blocks added to the blockchain. Originally (in 2008, at the time of Nakamoto’s white paper), mining meant only the process of computationally difficult puzzle.
          Node. Intersection point. I.e. the point at which lines or paths connect, converge, or diverge. In computer terminology, a node is a device (e.g. your phone or laptop) or even data point within a larger network.
          Nonce. Some value that is used only once. A variable.
          Peer-to-peer network. Network of computer-to-computer relationships wherein data and info are shared.
          Public-key cryptography. Encryption technique that uses a paired public key (like a username) with a private key (such as a password).
